      <h2><u>Jamaica</u></h2>
      <p> Out of all the Caribbean islands that I have visited, Jamaica has been my favorite. With delicious Caribbean jerk chicken, the kindest people, and a plethora of activities to do on the island, my trip to Jamaica for spring break in 2016 has been
        one of my favorites. We stayed at the Hyatt Ziva in Montego Bay, Jamaica. This was a beautiful, all inclusive resort that had an amazing pool and beach area. Our room was only feet away from the bright blue ocean water. There were also lots of
        delicious restaurants located on the resort property and the resort also had shows at night similar to a cruise. We also ventured off the resort property to see what the island really had to offer. I would definitely go back here someday! </p>

      <h2><u>Excursions</u></h2>
      <p>One reason I loved Jamaica so much is because I was able to do so many awesome things there. One of my favorites with going to an ATV rental place. We drove the ATV’s through the jungle, on the beach, up a mountain, and across farms. The place also
        had photographers who were able to get some good action shots! Another activity we did was take a cable car up a mountain in order to go ziplining back down. There was also an infinity pool atop of the mountain to hangout in. One other activity
        that I really enjoyed was climbing up Dunn’s River Falls. Although it not a very tall waterfall, it is 600 feet long and you are able to walk (and swim) all the way up starting from the ocean. If visiting here I definitely recommend having a pair
        of water shoes in order to not step on rocks or slip! Jamaica had so many amazing attractions that you cannot do every day! I had so much fun visiting this island.
