      <h2><u>Barcelona</u></h2>
      <p> In the summer of 2016, I visited Barcelona with my family. Barcelona is a large city located on the eastern coast of Spain and is full of beautiful sights, delicious food, and amazing art. The climate during the summer is pretty warm and we spent
        lots of time walking the streets and relaxing at the beach. Barcelona was also the home of artist and architect Antoni Gaudi and his influence can be seen throughout the city at areas such as the cathedral La Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. One
        very interesting part of Spain is how late people eat their meals. We didn’t eat dinner until 10 most nights! The food, however, is fantastic and we ordered lots of tapas. Other great sights in Barcelona include Las Ramblas, which is a street
        full of cafes and shops, and the Olympic village from when the Summer 1992 Olympics were hosted in Barcelona. This city is a great combination of modern and historic and I recommend it strongly to anyone! </p>

      <img src="Pics/barchotel.jpg" alt="The W Hotel in Barcelona">
      <h2><u>Where I Stayed</u></h2>
      <p> I actually stayed at two different locations in Barcelona. For the first three days and nights, we stayed at the W Hotel, which is a beautiful building located right on the beach. There is also an infinity pool overlooking the ocean! For the rest
        of the trip, we rented an apartment which was located more centrally in the city. While staying at hotels are very fun, I actually really enjoy staying in an apartment when staying in Europe as it feels more immersive and a better way to actually
        experience life in the city. We would buy our own groceries from a Spanish market nearby and cook a breakfast most mornings. By staying at both a hotel and an apartment, I felt like I was able to have both a tropical vacation and a cultural experience.

      <h2><u>Best Thing I Did</u></h2>
      <p>
        I had so many great experiences in Barcelona, but one of my favorites was definitely climbing to the top of Montserrat. This is a mountain range with a beautiful monastery built into the side of the cliffs. We climbed all the way to the top of one of
        the highest peaks and the view was one of the most breathtaking I have ever seen. To get to Montserrat, you can take an hour and a half train ride from Barcelona. After arriving by train, you take a cable car up to the main monastery level. From
        there you can hike up the mountain side as far as you like. Another thing I loved in Barcelona was the stadium tour of Camp Nou, which is the stadium where F.C. Barcelona plays. Some of the greatest soccer players in the world like Lionel Messi
        have played for Barcelona. It was a surreal experience to step on the grass those players have played on and enter the locker room they’ve been in. Barcelona is full of so many amazing sites and it was such a great experience getting to see them.
