      <h2><u>Yosemite</u></h2>
      <p> This past summer I visited Yosemite National Park, which is located in Californiaâ€™s Sierra Nevada mountains. The park is 1,169 square miles and includes huge granite formations such as El Capitan and Half Done as well as many waterfalls. My family
        and I spent our days hiking up different trails and enjoying the beautiful views. With plenty of redwoods within the park, the whole place has an amazing and refreshing scent. If you are a fan of nature I definitely recommend checking out this
        great destination within our own country!

      <h2><u>Where I Stayed</u></h2>
      <p>
        Although you can camp within the park, my family and I stayed in a lodge located just outside the park called Rush Creek Lodge. This place was brand new and we had a great time! There was a nice pool area and restaurant located on the property so we did
        not have to venture too far after spending the days in the park. One of the best parts of the Rush Creek Lodge was that they had a bonfire with smores each night!

      <h2><u>Best Thing I Did</u></h2>
      <p>
        Yosemite National Park is full of so many different trails to take, but one of my favorites was the Mystic Falls trail. This 3 mile trail takes you right up close to the a powerful waterfall that will definitely soak you, but if you are travelling to
        Yosemite you will dry off quickly. Another great hike we took was up to Taft point. At the peak, we saw people tight roping over a huge gap that dropped hundreds of feet to the ground. There are definitely some daring people to be found within
        Yosemite. My last place I would recommend visiting is Rainbow Pools, where you can do some daring activities yourself. Here you can cliff jump into a natural pool of water. This is a great place to cool off when the weather is hot. Yosemite is
        place full of beauty and excitement.
